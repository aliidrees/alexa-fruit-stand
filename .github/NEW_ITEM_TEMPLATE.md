# Item Template

If you'd like to add support for new fruits and vegetables, make sure you provide the following:

- [ ] update `src/instructions.js` to add the storage instructions for the new Item
- [ ] run `npm test` to make sure it works
- [ ] include a reference to your source of information in the pull request

This will be used to ensure that we give correct information to users.
